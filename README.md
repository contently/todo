Ruby Developer Homework
================
Candidate: Zee Perez Canals zperezcanals@gmail.com

To complete this homework, you will work on a simple Todo app in Rails. Our expectation is that you timebox the effort to 2 to 4 hours. You may work on any of the stories in the list below, but you are not expected to complete them all. Code quality is more important than quantity, we are more interested in how you approach the problems than how many you solve. Some of the user stories are ambiguous, there are many acceptable solutions, use your judgement. Frontend improvements are welcome, but optional.

You may be asked to explain your work and pair with a Contently engineer to further enhance the app.

To submit your homework, please update this README with information about which stories you completed, and submit the app as a zip file.

How I approached the task
----------------
I chose the user studies below because they required work that was a bit more complex, and would allow me to add additonal functionality to the app. With implementing devise and a "lists" table, I focused on relationships and how the users would have the ability to create collection or lists of tasks to be accomplished. I spent the majority of my time working on testing these relationships and making sure they worked. 

While working on the homework, I was working on other coding challenges and thus was not able to implement other stories. The next story I wanted to work on was the "completing task after creating".

Please see video for functionality intro. 

User stories to implemented
----------------
 - Was working on "Completing tasks" on edit view rather than while creating a task. 
 - A user should be able to keep multiple lists.
 - A user should have access to only their tasks. (may require devise or a creative, lightweight auth system)
