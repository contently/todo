Ruby Developer Homework
================

To complete this homework, you will work on a simple Todo app in Rails. Our expectation is that you timebox the effort to 2 to 4 hours. You may work on any of the stories in the list below, but you are not expected to complete them all. Code quality is more important than quantity, we are more interested in how you approach the problems than how many you solve. Some of the user stories are ambiguous, there are many acceptable solutions, use your judgement. Frontend improvements are welcome, but optional.

You may be asked to explain your work and pair with a Contently engineer to further enhance the app.

To submit your homework, please update this README with information about which stories you completed, and submit the app as a zip file.
